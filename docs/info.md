## How it works

Tiny Canvas is a hardware implementation of an MS Paint-style drawing application. It receives input from an SNES-compatible gamepad controller via the [Gamepad PMOD](https://github.com/psychogenic/gamepad_pmod) and streams canvas coordinates and color data over I2C to a host device.

### Core Functionality

**Color Mixing**: The Y, X, and B buttons toggle Red, Green, and Blue color channels respectively. These combine additively to produce 8 colors:
- R+G = Yellow, R+B = Magenta, G+B = Cyan, R+G+B = White
- When no color is selected, the cursor moves without painting

**Brush Controls**: 
- L/R shoulder buttons adjust brush size from 1×1 to 8×8 pixels
- Start button cycles through symmetry modes: Off → Horizontal → Vertical → 4-Way

**Fill Rectangle**: Select button toggles fill mode. Press A to set corner A, move cursor, press A again to set corner B and fill the rectangle.

**Undo/Redo**: L+R together undoes, Select+Start together redoes (4-operation buffer).

### Architecture

The design consists of modular Verilog components:
- `gamepad_pmod_single`: Decodes SNES controller serial protocol
- `colour`: RGB mixing logic with smart paint-enable
- `position`: 8-bit X/Y cursor tracking  
- `brush_settings`: Size (0-7) and symmetry mode (0-3) control
- `packet_generator`: Expands single pixels to brush footprint with symmetry
- `fill_mode` / `fill_draw`: Fill rectangle state machine and pixel generator
- `undo_redo`: 4-entry circular buffer for undo/redo operations
- `i2c_slave`: Read-only I2C slave at address 0x64

### I2C Protocol

Reading 3 bytes from address `0x64` returns:
| Byte | Content |
|------|---------|
| 0 | X position (0-255) |
| 1 | Y position (0-255) |
| 2 | Status: `[7:4]=D-pad, [3]=BrushMode, [2:0]=RGB` |

## How to test

### Using the Interactive Emulator

1. Install dependencies: `pip install pygame cocotb`
2. Run the emulator: `python test/interactive_emulator.py`
3. Use keyboard controls:
   - Arrow keys: Move cursor
   - R/G/B: Toggle color channels
   - +/-: Adjust brush size
   - S: Cycle symmetry mode
   - F: Toggle fill mode
   - Space: Set fill corner
   - Z/Y: Undo/Redo

### On Hardware

1. Connect the Gamepad PMOD to `ui[0:2]` (data, clock, latch)
2. Connect I2C: SDA to `uio[1]`, SCL to `uio[2]`
3. Poll the I2C slave at address `0x64` to read canvas state
4. Use controller buttons as documented to draw

### Running Cocotb Tests

```bash
cd test
make
```

## External hardware

**Required:**
- [Gamepad PMOD](https://github.com/psychogenic/gamepad_pmod) - SNES controller interface
- SNES-compatible game controller

**For canvas display:**
- I2C master device (e.g., RP2040 on the Tiny Tapeout demoboard)
- Display or computer running host software to render the canvas

The I2C interface streams X, Y, and color data at each paint event, allowing a host device to render the 256×256 canvas in real-time.
